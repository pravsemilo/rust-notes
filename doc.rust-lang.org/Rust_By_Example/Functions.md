# Functions
* Functions are declared used the `fn` keyword.
* Its arguments are type annotated.
* If the function returns a value, the return type must be specified after an arrow `->`.
* The final expression in the function will be used as return value.
	* Alternatively, the `return` statement can be used to return a value earlier from within the function.
```rust
// Unlike C/C++, there's no restriction on the order of function definitions
fn main() {
    // We can use this function here, and define it somewhere later
    fizzbuzz_to(100);
}

// Function that returns a boolean value
fn is_divisible_by(lhs: u32, rhs: u32) -> bool {
    // Corner case, early return
    if rhs == 0 {
        return false;
    }

    // This is an expression, the `return` keyword is not necessary here
    lhs % rhs == 0
}

// Functions that "don't" return a value, actually return the unit type `()`
fn fizzbuzz(n: u32) -> () {
    if is_divisible_by(n, 15) {
        println!("fizzbuzz");
    } else if is_divisible_by(n, 3) {
        println!("fizz");
    } else if is_divisible_by(n, 5) {
        println!("buzz");
    } else {
        println!("{}", n);
    }
}

// When a function returns `()`, the return type can be omitted from the
// signature
fn fizzbuzz_to(n: u32) {
    for n in 1..n + 1 {
        fizzbuzz(n);
    }
}
```
## Methods
* Methods are functions attached to objects.
* Methods have access to the data of the object and its other methods via the `self` keyword.
* Methods are defined under an `impl` block.
```rust
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// Implementation block, all `Point` methods go in here
impl Point {
    // This is a static method
    // Static methods don't need to be called by an instance
    // These methods are generally used as constructors
    fn origin() -> Point {
        Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }
    }

    // Another static method, taking two arguments:
    fn new(x: f64, y: f64) -> Point {
        Point { x: x, y: y }
    }
}

struct Rectangle {
    p1: Point,
    p2: Point,
}

impl Rectangle {
    // This is an instance method
    // `&self` is sugar for `self: &Self`, where `Self` is the type of the
    // caller object. In this case `Self` = `Rectangle`
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        // `self` gives access to the struct fields via the dot operator
        let Point { x: x1, y: y1 } = self.p1;
        let Point { x: x2, y: y2 } = self.p2;

        // `abs` is a `f64` method that returns the absolute value of the
        // caller
        ((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y2)).abs()
    }

    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        let Point { x: x1, y: y1 } = self.p1;
        let Point { x: x2, y: y2 } = self.p2;

        2.0 * ((x1 - x2).abs() + (y1 - y2).abs())
    }

    // This method requires the caller object to be mutable
    // `&mut self` desugars to `self: &mut Self`
    fn translate(&mut self, x: f64, y: f64) {
        self.p1.x += x;
        self.p2.x += x;

        self.p1.y += y;
        self.p2.y += y;
    }
}

// `Pair` owns resources: two heap allocated integers
struct Pair(Box<i32>, Box<i32>);

impl Pair {
    // This method "consumes" the resources of the caller object
    // `self` desugars to `self: Self`
    fn destroy(self) {
        // Destructure `self`
        let Pair(first, second) = self;

        println!("Destroying Pair({}, {})", first, second);

        // `first` and `second` go out of scope and get freed
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle {
        // Static methods are called using double colons
        p1: Point::origin(),
        p2: Point::new(3.0, 4.0),
    };

    // Instance methods are called using the dot operator
    // Note that the first argument `&self` is implicitly passed, i.e.
    // `rectangle.perimeter()` === `Rectangle::perimeter(&rectangle)`
    println!("Rectangle perimeter: {}", rectangle.perimeter());
    println!("Rectangle area: {}", rectangle.area());

    let mut square = Rectangle {
        p1: Point::origin(),
        p2: Point::new(1.0, 1.0),
    };

    // Error! `rectangle` is immutable, but this method requires a mutable
    // object
    //rectangle.translate(1.0, 0.0);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // Okay! Mutable objects can call mutable methods
    square.translate(1.0, 1.0);

    let pair = Pair(Box::new(1), Box::new(2));

    pair.destroy();

    // Error! Previous `destroy` call "consumed" `pair`
    //pair.destroy();
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line
}
```
## Closures
* Closures are functions that can capture the enclosing environment.
* Closure are also called lambda expressions or lambdas.
* For example, a closure that captures the x variable :
```rust
|val| val + x
```
* The syntax and capabilities of closures make them very convenient for on the fly usage.
	* Calling the closure is exactly like calling a function.
	* Both input and return types _can_ be inferred
	* Input variable names _must_ be specified.
* Other characterstics of closures include :
	* Using `||` instead of `()` around input variables.
	* Optional body delimitation (`{}`) for a single expression (mandatory otherwise).
	* The ability to capture the outer environment variables.
```rust
fn main() {
    // Increment via closures and functions.
    fn  function            (i: i32) -> i32 { i + 1 }

    // Closures are anonymous, here we are binding them to references
    // Annotation is identical to function annotation but is optional
    // as are the `{}` wrapping the body. These nameless functions
    // are assigned to appropriately named variables.
    let closure_annotated = |i: i32| -> i32 { i + 1 };
    let closure_inferred  = |i     |          i + 1  ;

    let i = 1;
    // Call the function and closures.
    println!("function: {}", function(i));
    println!("closure_annotated: {}", closure_annotated(i));
    println!("closure_inferred: {}", closure_inferred(i));

    // A closure taking no arguments which returns an `i32`.
    // The return type is inferred.
    let one = || 1;
    println!("closure returning one: {}", one());

}
```
### Capturing
* Closure allows capturing to flexibly adapt to the use case, sometimes moving and sometimes borrowing.
* Closures can capture variables :
	* By reference `&T`.
	* By mutable reference `&mut T`.
	* By value `T`.
* Closures will preferentially capture variables by reference and only go lower when required.
```rust
fn main() {
    use std::mem;

    let color = "green";

    // A closure to print `color` which immediately borrows (`&`) `color` and
    // stores the borrow and closure in the `print` variable. It will remain
    // borrowed until `print` is used the last time.
    //
    // `println!` only requires arguments by immutable reference so it doesn't
    // impose anything more restrictive.
    let print = || println!("`color`: {}", color);

    // Call the closure using the borrow.
    print();

    // `color` can be borrowed immutably again, because the closure only holds
    // an immutable reference to `color`.
    let _reborrow = &color;
    print();

    // A move or reborrow is allowed after the final use of `print`
    let _color_moved = color;


    let mut count = 0;
    // A closure to increment `count` could take either `&mut count` or `count`
    // but `&mut count` is less restrictive so it takes that. Immediately
    // borrows `count`.
    //
    // A `mut` is required on `inc` because a `&mut` is stored inside. Thus,
    // calling the closure mutates the closure which requires a `mut`.
    let mut inc = || {
        count += 1;
        println!("`count`: {}", count);
    };

    // Call the closure using a mutable borrow.
    inc();

    // The closure still mutably borrows `count` because it is called later.
    // An attempt to reborrow will lead to an error.
    // let _reborrow = &count;
    // ^ TODO: try uncommenting this line.
    inc();

    // The closure no longer needs to borrow `&mut count`. Therefore, it is
    // possible to reborrow without an error
    let _count_reborrowed = &mut count;


    // A non-copy type.
    let movable = Box::new(3);

    // `mem::drop` requires `T` so this must take by value. A copy type
    // would copy into the closure leaving the original untouched.
    // A non-copy must move and so `movable` immediately moves into
    // the closure.
    let consume = || {
        println!("`movable`: {:?}", movable);
        mem::drop(movable);
    };

    // `consume` consumes the variable so this can only be called once.
    consume();
    // consume();
    // ^ TODO: Try uncommenting this line.
}
```
* Using `move` before vertical pipes forces closure to take ownership of captured variables.
```rust
fn main() {
    // `Vec` has non-copy semantics.
    let haystack = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let contains = move |needle| haystack.contains(needle);

    println!("{}", contains(&1));
    println!("{}", contains(&4));

    // println!("There're {} elements in vec", haystack.len());
    // ^ Uncommenting above line will result in compile-time error
    // because borrow checker doesn't allow re-using variable after it
    // has been moved.
    
    // Removing `move` from closure's signature will cause closure
    // to borrow _haystack_ variable immutably, hence _haystack_ is still
    // available and uncommenting above line will not cause an error.
}
```
### As input parameters
* When a function takes a closure as an input parameter, the closure's complete type must be annotated using following `traits` in decreasing order.
	* `Fn` : The closure captures by reference (`&T`).
	* `FnMut` : The closure captures by mutable reference (`&mut T`).
	* `FnOnce` : The closure captures by value (`T`).
* On a variable by variable basis, the compiler will capture variables in the least restrictive manner.
* If a parameter is annotated as `FnOnce`, this implies that closure may capture by `&T`, `&mut T` or `T`, but the compiler will ultimately choose based on how the captured variables are used in the closure.
```rust
// A function which takes a closure as an argument and calls it.
// <F> denotes that F is a "Generic type parameter"
fn apply<F>(f: F) where
    // The closure takes no input and returns nothing.
    F: FnOnce() {
    // ^ TODO: Try changing this to `Fn` or `FnMut`.

    f();
}

// A function which takes a closure and returns an `i32`.
fn apply_to_3<F>(f: F) -> i32 where
    // The closure takes an `i32` and returns an `i32`.
    F: Fn(i32) -> i32 {

    f(3)
}

fn main() {
    use std::mem;

    let greeting = "hello";
    // A non-copy type.
    // `to_owned` creates owned data from borrowed one
    let mut farewell = "goodbye".to_owned();

    // Capture 2 variables: `greeting` by reference and
    // `farewell` by value.
    let diary = || {
        // `greeting` is by reference: requires `Fn`.
        println!("I said {}.", greeting);

        // Mutation forces `farewell` to be captured by
        // mutable reference. Now requires `FnMut`.
        farewell.push_str("!!!");
        println!("Then I screamed {}.", farewell);
        println!("Now I can sleep. zzzzz");

        // Manually calling drop forces `farewell` to
        // be captured by value. Now requires `FnOnce`.
        mem::drop(farewell);
    };

    // Call the function which applies the closure.
    apply(diary);

    // `double` satisfies `apply_to_3`'s trait bound
    let double = |x| 2 * x;

    println!("3 doubled: {}", apply_to_3(double));
}
```
### Type anonymity
* When a closure is defined, the compiler implicitly creates a new anonymous structure to store the captured variables inside.
* The compiler also implements the functionality via one of the traits : `Fn`, `FnMut` or `FnOnce` for the unknown type.
* This type is assigned to the variable which is stored until calling.
* Since this new type is of unknown type, any usage in a function will require generics.
* In this case an unbounded type parameter woule be ambiguous.
* However bounding by one of the traits : `Fn`, `FnMut` or `FnOnce` is sufficient.
### Input functions
* If a function takes a closure as input parameter, then any function that satisfies the trait bound can be passed as a parameter.
```rust
// Define a function which takes a generic `F` argument
// bounded by `Fn`, and calls it
fn call_me<F: Fn()>(f: F) {
    f();
}

// Define a wrapper function satisfying the `Fn` bound
fn function() {
    println!("I'm a function!");
}

fn main() {
    // Define a closure satisfying the `Fn` bound
    let closure = || println!("I'm a closure!");

    call_me(closure);
    call_me(function);
}
```
* The `Fn`, `FnMut` and `FnOnce` traits also dictate how a closure captures variables from the enclosing scope.
### As output parameters
* Since anonymous closure types are unknown, we have to use `impl <<Trait>>` to return them.
* Valid traits for returning a closure are :
	* `Fn`
	* `FnMut`
	* `FnOnce`
* Also the `move` keyword must be used, which signals that all captures occur by value.
* This is because any captures by reference would be dropped as soon as the function exited, leaving invalid references in the closure.
```rust
fn create_fn() -> impl Fn() {
    let text = "Fn".to_owned();

    move || println!("This is a: {}", text)
}

fn create_fnmut() -> impl FnMut() {
    let text = "FnMut".to_owned();

    move || println!("This is a: {}", text)
}

fn create_fnonce() -> impl FnOnce() {
    let text = "FnOnce".to_owned();

    move || println!("This is a: {}", text)
}

fn main() {
    let fn_plain = create_fn();
    let mut fn_mut = create_fnmut();
    let fn_once = create_fnonce();

    fn_plain();
    fn_mut();
    fn_once();
}
```
### Examples in std
#### Iteraor::any
* `Iterator::any` is a function which when passed an iterator, will return `true` if any element satisfies the predicate, false otherwise.
```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    // The type being iterated over.
    type Item;

    // `any` takes `&mut self` meaning the caller may be borrowed
    // and modified, but not consumed.
    fn any<F>(&mut self, f: F) -> bool where
        // `FnMut` meaning any captured variable may at most be
        // modified, not consumed. `Self::Item` states it takes
        // arguments to the closure by value.
        F: FnMut(Self::Item) -> bool {}
}
```
```rust
fn main() {
    let vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let vec2 = vec![4, 5, 6];

    // `iter()` for vecs yields `&i32`. Destructure to `i32`.
    println!("2 in vec1: {}", vec1.iter()     .any(|&x| x == 2));
    // `into_iter()` for vecs yields `i32`. No destructuring required.
    println!("2 in vec2: {}", vec2.into_iter().any(| x| x == 2));

    let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
    let array2 = [4, 5, 6];

    // `iter()` for arrays yields `&i32`.
    println!("2 in array1: {}", array1.iter()     .any(|&x| x == 2));
    // `into_iter()` for arrays unusually yields `&i32`.
    println!("2 in array2: {}", array2.into_iter().any(|&x| x == 2));
}
```
#### Searching through iterators
* `Iterator::find` is a function which iterates over an iterator and searches for the first value which satisfies some condition, `None` otherwise.
```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    // The type being iterated over.
    type Item;

    // `find` takes `&mut self` meaning the caller may be borrowed
    // and modified, but not consumed.
    fn find<P>(&mut self, predicate: P) -> Option<Self::Item> where
        // `FnMut` meaning any captured variable may at most be
        // modified, not consumed. `&Self::Item` states it takes
        // arguments to the closure by reference.
        P: FnMut(&Self::Item) -> bool {}
}
```
```rust
fn main() {
    let vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let vec2 = vec![4, 5, 6];

    // `iter()` for vecs yields `&i32`.
    let mut iter = vec1.iter();
    // `into_iter()` for vecs yields `i32`.
    let mut into_iter = vec2.into_iter();

    // `iter()` for vecs yields `&i32`, and we want to reference one of its
    // items, so we have to destructure `&&i32` to `i32`
    println!("Find 2 in vec1: {:?}", iter     .find(|&&x| x == 2));
    // `into_iter()` for vecs yields `i32`, and we want to reference one of
    // its items, so we have to destructure `&i32` to `i32`
    println!("Find 2 in vec2: {:?}", into_iter.find(| &x| x == 2));

    let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
    let array2 = [4, 5, 6];

    // `iter()` for arrays yields `&i32`
    println!("Find 2 in array1: {:?}", array1.iter()     .find(|&&x| x == 2));
    // `into_iter()` for arrays unusually yields `&i32`
    println!("Find 2 in array2: {:?}", array2.into_iter().find(|&&x| x == 2));
}
```
## Higher Order Functions
* Higher order functions are functions that take one or more functions and / or produce a more useful function.
* Higher order functions and lazy iterators give Rust its functional flavor.
* [Option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/option/enum.Option.html) and [Iterator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/iter/trait.Iterator.html) implement their fair share of higher order functions.
```rust
fn is_odd(n: u32) -> bool {
    n % 2 == 1
}

fn main() {
    println!("Find the sum of all the squared odd numbers under 1000");
    let upper = 1000;

    // Imperative approach
    // Declare accumulator variable
    let mut acc = 0;
    // Iterate: 0, 1, 2, ... to infinity
    for n in 0.. {
        // Square the number
        let n_squared = n * n;

        if n_squared >= upper {
            // Break loop if exceeded the upper limit
            break;
        } else if is_odd(n_squared) {
            // Accumulate value, if it's odd
            acc += n_squared;
        }
    }
    println!("imperative style: {}", acc);

    // Functional approach
    let sum_of_squared_odd_numbers: u32 =
        (0..).map(|n| n * n)                             // All natural numbers squared
             .take_while(|&n_squared| n_squared < upper) // Below upper limit
             .filter(|&n_squared| is_odd(n_squared))     // That are odd
             .fold(0, |acc, n_squared| acc + n_squared); // Sum them
    println!("functional style: {}", sum_of_squared_odd_numbers);
}
```
## Diverging functions
* Diverging functions never return.
* They are marked using `!`, which is an empty type.
```rust
fn foo() -> ! {
    panic!("This call never returns.");
}
```
* As opposed to other types, this one cannot be instantiated, because the set of all possible values is empty.
* It is different from the `()` type, which has exactly one possible value.
```rust
fn some_fn() {
    ()
}

fn main() {
    let a: () = some_fn();
    println!("This function returns and you can see this line.")
}
```
```rust
#![feature(never_type)]

fn main() {
    let x: ! = panic!("This call never returns.");
    println!("You will never see this line!");
}
```
* The main advantage of this type is that it can be cast to any other one and therefore used at places where an exact type is required, for instance in `match` branches.
```rust
fn main() {
    fn sum_odd_numbers(up_to: u32) -> u32 {
        let mut acc = 0;
        for i in 0..up_to {
            // Notice that the return type of this match expression must be u32
            // because of the type of the "addition" variable.
            let addition: u32 = match i%2 == 1 {
                // The "i" variable is of type u32, which is perfectly fine.
                true => i,
                // On the other hand, the "continue" expression does not return
                // u32, but it is still fine, because it never returns and therefore
                // does not violate the type requirements of the match expression.
                false => continue,
            };
            acc += addition;
        }
        acc
    }
    println!("Sum of odd numbers up to 9 (excluding): {}", sum_odd_numbers(9));
}
```
* It is also the return type of functions that loop forever (`loop {}`) like network servers or functions that terminate the process (`exit()`).
